These are the source [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) templates that will get exported to the other content management systems. You don't actually need to set up Pattern Lab for the exports to work, but if you want to see the patterns in context, extract a copy of Pattern Lab into this folder and [run it](http://patternlab.io/docs/command-line.html) (in case it matters, this was set up using version 0.7.12). If you want to modify the css, you'll also need to set up [Compass](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-integration-with-compass.html).
