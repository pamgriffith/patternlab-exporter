This project is an experiment in exporting patterns from a pattern library (in this case [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io)) into various content managment systems to see how well I can make a pattern library be a living part of a website. The idea is that changes to the design of a site *must* be made to the pattern library and then get ported into the site so that the pattern library is always up to date.
